My name is Jake Colleran and I love cooking with specifically shallots, collard greens and snap peas. I am an ACT major and I plan to work in network security. I spend most of my time playing hockey, video games, and writing programming assignments. I have lived in many different places  before, but I am currently living in parker Colorado. Iâ€™m in my junior year of college and I plan to graduate in a year and a half.
